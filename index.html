       </hr></hr>
       <p style="color: #0000ff;">This website is all about moskinator bot it's currently under developement </p>
       <h2 style="color: #FF0000;">Introducing Moskinator!</h2>
       <p style="color: #0000ff;">Moskinator is a fun bot under devolopement, we would like to improve it to a high level of popularity and make it fun to play!it's currently developed by only 2 new developers which makes it hard to progress in a short amount of time. </p>
       <h2 style="color: #FF0000;">What Does Moskinator Currently Have?</h2>
       <p style="color: #0000ff;">Moskinator is currently just a little bot with little to nothing commands such as /m fly /m fed @Username Currently nothing big but we would like to improve it to a high level where people will find it like every other</p>
       <h2 style="color: #FF0000;">How did the idea of Moskinator come?</h2>
       <p style="color: #0000ff;">The idea of Moskinator Bot came from smolboi he was pretty bored wanted to learn new stuff so the idea of making a bot came to his mind and started learn JssNode,JavaScript While GamingGoneDope Learned Html the collab made a really efficent role to the development of the bot and will continue till it will reach our goal of high popularity and 1000 Active Server!</p>

       <h1 style="color: #FF0000;">Testing Area</h1>
       <p style="color: #0000ff;"><big>T</big> the T should be bigger than this 'T'and <small>T</small> and this T should be smaller than this 'T'</p>
       <h1 style="color: #FF0000;"><big style="color: #0000ff">T</big> if the letter 'T'is in the color Aqua it means that the code (big style="color: #0000ff") worked</h1>
       <p style="color: #0000ff;"><big style="color: #FF0000;">T</big> if the letter 'T'is in the color Red  it means that the code (big style="color: #0000ff") worked</p>
       <h1 style="color: #FF0000;">Code used for science bodies</h1>
       <p style="color: #0000ff;">If you want to add Like H2O and make it special u can use the code 'sub' for example: H<sub>2</sub>O as u can see it's pretty useful for science websites</p>
       <h1 style="color: #FF0000;">Code For Maths</h1>
       <p style="color: #0000ff;">You can use a code called 'sup'to make a little number over the others numbers like if you want 10x10 it means 10 with upper 2 but higher numbers you really wouldn't use big like 10x10x10x10 so html code actually helps you and make it as little as possible by using the code called 'sub' for example: 10<sup>4</sup> means 10x10x10x10</p>
       <h1 style="color: #FF0000;">Curvy Writing</h1>
       <p style="color: #0000ff;">If you want to make your website abit more fancy well you can use the code 'I' to make your writing more fancy! example Hello <i>everyone</i> it should be curvy now</p>
       <h1 style="color: #FF0000;">Lines And Heads</h1>
       <p style="color: #0000ff;">if you want to add head overs or something u can use a code called 'hr'it means Horizantal Line now down of this text you should see two horizantal lines </p>
       <hr/>
       <hr/>
       <h1 style="color: #FF0000;">Comments</h1>
       <p style="color: #0000ff;">Comments are invisible codes that can only be seen in the code itself and it's used as a reminder at most points and the code is '!--' and now ill write a comment and i will only be able to see it in the code
       <!--This is how to use a reminer/comments and don't forget to close to -->

        this text ur currently reading if you can actually read it is coded with 'article' that is used like blogpost to put an article but i don't know how to how it fully so am just putting random stuff to test it out thank you
         <section> this is written in a section inside a code called 'section' so lets test it out by making two sections </section>
         <section> this is section two and lets see what the code gives us </section>
         <section> the result was it made them seperate lines which means u can have less long lines and also add diffirent colors which is pretty cool for a nice colored website </section>
         <section> <aside> inside of 'section' code you can use 'aside' code which means it's not linked to the subject of your website or something like that and as always it just shows inside the code for reminders or i don't know their perks </aside></section>
